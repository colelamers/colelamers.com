              First, I'd like to clarify, my name is Cole Lamers, pronounced <span style="color: cornflowerblue;">(Kohl Lay-merz)</span>. For a fairly anglicanized name, you'd be amazed at how many people get it wrong. The last name most people say "Lah-mers" or "Lamb-mers." I think it's just cause people don't want to say the word "lame." Apparently the reason we have the last name is cause one of my Dutch ancestors just decided to give his children the name. His name was "Lambertus", and my ancestor being unoriginal, just dropped the BTU. He removed the only shred of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_thermal_unit">energy</a> from our name.
            </p>
            <p>
              To sort of give a basic rundown of my heritage of what I've found, I'm basically as Germanic/Frankish as they come. Since none of you have the evidence to prove me wrong, I'm related to Charlemagne. Like all good pretenders, I will stake my own claim on faulty evidence and irrational connections.
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Basically my Grandmother on my mothers side is primarily Dutch/Low country.</li>
              <li>My Grandfather on my fathers side is pretty much 100% Dutch.</li>
              <li>My Grandfather on my mothers side is Pomeranian/Palatinate German with some Dutch, Belgian, and Luxembourger to boot. For those of you who aren't aware, these people (besides the Pomeranians) are basically within a 50 mile radius.</li>
              <li>Lastly, my Grandmother on my fathers side is basically the "mutt" of Europeans. She is: Polish, French (like every kind including Canadian, excluding Parisian), German (mostly ex-Prussian German...so basically Polish), and a dash of English.</li>
            </ul>

              Also, wo waren wir? I'd like to apologize for the horrible German, it's a hard language and even some italki teachers told me to practice more. But I blame them for having such a complicated language. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Awful_German_Language">Even Mark Twain criticized it</a>, so I feel somewhat vindicated by my efforts. Talking like an idiot but being understood is 10x better than not being able to speak it at all. So take that Germans.

              Anyways, I hope you find some of these tidbits interesting. Here's my favorite photo I took in New York:

              I am not a big traveler, but I have been known to dabble in the middle class art of throwing money away to a state that I don't live in. I never really understood the purpose of it, but it's neat to do as it gives you a different perspective of life. One thought I've had on the process is that it's essentially a startup where you throw money at it to stave boredom away. Then when you get to the airport, you really start justifying reasons to spend money because you're so phenomenally bored, waiting to get on the plane while a family of 16 who has never played Tetris figures out how to put their carry ons in the luggage compartment for their 1 day stay in Whocaresvilles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another thing I dabble in from time to time is pottery. Yes, like Bob Ross himself I am a calm, talented, potter. Hence my pottery website link at the top...<a href="http://www.colespottery.com">or here.</a> I'm no longer using an automated checkout and just doing it based on inquiries only. But you can always pay by other means too.

              Take a guess where I learned how? If you guessed high school (which is like 99.99% of the same answer everybody gives) you would be correct. Actually I had two classes in high school, then found this pottery studio near me that allows for me to do this. So that's pretty cool. Check out my site for a lot of my work. It's definitely not up to date. Hopefully you'll soon find out why I have no free time for even my websites.

              But when I'm not moonlighting as a dapper young struggling artist, by day I'm actually a programmer here in the midwest. Yes that's right. I could not make the great Hajj pilgrimage to the Mecca of Silicon that is San Francisco. But, I fill a niche here and it's enjoyable. No complicated data structures, no bloated frameworks, no excessive coding procedures, just clean simple C#.NET. <a href="https://www.github.com/colelamers">Feel free to check out some of my code on github.</a> Please note, past code is not indicative of current behavior.

              Next up, let me introduce you to another part of my life. I have been known to dabble in the musical varieties of life. Maybe one day I'll do it professionally, or just whenever I feel like it to keep a smile on my face. Overall I really enjoy acoustic songs or the blues. Although oddly enough I have been dabbling in the surfer-spanish-arabic variety as of late. Maybe I'll give Santana a run for his money some day. Or make Dick Dale look like Bill Haley and his Comets.

              Running has been my "Stand Rock" of the very stoney Wisconsin Dells. Keeps me healthy and reminds me to check my pulse from time to time. That and along with my exercise bike if I need to give my knees a break. I never understood runners high until after a couple years of running. Started with a mile, bumped it to a 5k, then 10k for a while, then back to 5k. On occasion I'll run even when it's in the negatives if the wind isn't bad. That's one thing you'll learn when running. The wind is awful. And somehow out of the entire world, I live in one of the windiest regions. If I was world dictator, my first edict would be to ban the wind, because frankly I'm sick of 40mph+ gusts beating down my chest when I'm just trying to move forward. Vote for me, 20XX.

              As of right now, that's basically me in a nutshell. Hope to keep doing this more though in the long term and make more updates as I go.
