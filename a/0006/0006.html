            I'll admit it, ever since learning how to program and getting my CS degree, I've been ever more averse to computers. Now they're just pointless news machines to me where I do nothing but stare at the few websites I care about today, only to remember I should focus on more productive things. It has been a challenge all my life. When I was younger, I had no money and my parents didn't buy me a lot outside of birthdays or Christmas, so I was phenomenally bored most of the year. The internet practically staved off most of that boredom because there was so much to learn about, so much to do, places to visit. Into high school, I was that person who basically didn't entirely know how to appropriately differentiate between the online world and real life. Fortunately, high school doesn't really matter all that much, so I got to make my mistakes when they hardly matter. Then into my 20's, I struggled with finding hobbies outside of the internet, my phone, and video games.

            Now having gone back and gotten a degree in Computer Science, nothing makes me hate a computer more when I have to go through ridiculously complicated hoops just to do something as basic as serving a webpage. Today it's a good and bad thing because there is a wealth of well made languages that save me tons of time. With that, there are also a lot of fad oriented programming systems that I now have to learn because people who don't understand the full scope of serving websites. Sure the salaries of programmers is great, but do you really want to have to take time out of your busy days after work to keep your resume sharp learning all these new systems, just to stay employable? If you stagnate, an interviewer will question it. So you're either tasked with sticking around just long enough to move elsewhere, or staying somewhere forever. Not to mention the ageism in programmers over the age of 40 in many tech spheres makes it almost as if you have to make your way to a management role around or before then.

            Peering behind the curtain, this work isn't complicated. It's getting it to work the way you want it to that is. It's just mind <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSfebOXSBOE">bottlingly</a> tedious as well as how today every business let's (or makes) you pay online, so now I need like 30 accounts for everything to go shopping. Not to mention your tracked for everything you do so it's basically Minority Report in terms of ads just without the personal touch. Also you have no choice but to play in this overly complicated system that you're supposed to trust.

            Cars have touchscreens in them in lieu of physical knobs. I get why this is the case, but since it's not easy to upgrade the software, it makes it rather annoying. I just need a car to get me from A to B, not a fancy tech gadget to show off to the one person who may get in my car every now and then. My TV has an operating system in it as well. Seriously, I just need the thing to connect to an HDMI/Displayport. I don't care about your super cheap worthless computer and processor that can't handle the bloated operating system you put on here. Also we see it in guitar amps, exercise equipment, coffee makers, or blenders when those are the last reason I'm buying the product. It's as if product designers worldwide are colluding in making a market nobody wants filled with excessive electronics that are sure to fail or degrade so a consumer needs to buy it again.

            Since I've had plenty of overly complicated products fail on me (ones that I've definitely paid a premium for), I just can't justify buying these overtly complicated products. Honestly I try to use computers only for work related tasks as much as I can. I block tons of websites just to make it a hassle to view them, simply because they just suck away my time. Social media thankfully has never been a problem so it's all but a bare minimum use for me. Youtube I block all recommendations and it's just a blank page with a search bar to me. I can only go back once I'm on a video I'm watching. There are no recommendations aside from the channel I'm looking at. Heck, I even bought a printer just to have physical paper to look at and reference just to keep my eyes away from a computer for studying german. The applications I use on my computers are primarily all FOSS based or freeware. I only have a select few apps on my phone, no games or social media there. The most entertaining ones are an epub reader and a music player.

            I often feel like an outsider because culturally, I'm wrong here. I know it full well. But it's just annoying to me that universally we've accepted that being addicted to these new forms of opium or cigarettes, if you will, is tolerable. I won't be shocked if 100 years from now, we'll be evaluating the merits of excessive technology dependence like the government did with cigarettes and drugs in the 80's. Not to mention the failure rates on these machines when something goes wrong, basically the entire product is worthless because it can't function without that, even though the hardware is fine. It is absurd when the hardware is fine, it just can't talk to the garbage software that many of these companies can't afford to support.
          </p>
          <p>
            To me, it's not even about these items coming to take my job or anyone elses job away. It's hardly that. Since I at least understand how the sausage is made regarding software, and have a bit of insight in the industry, there is absolutely no way in hell I'd ever tolerate this long term. When companies can just fire people directly responsible for supporting these systems on a whim even though many people rely on them, only for the company to just go out of business, you start to question what is the point in buying these items when corporations just churn out garbage with no intent (or capability to survive long enough) to actually support these systems. Because the hardest part about software development isn't building it, it's supporting the billion niche edge cases that everyone else is inevitably going to encounter.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't know really what to say or think about it nowadays. I know people are going one way, and I know the direction technology is going, but I am so confident in who I am that I frankly don't care about fads sweeping the world like this. Social media to me is just a marketing platform and nothing else. That is why I don't spend absurd amounts of time going all in on posting to them simply because it is a humongous time sink. Not to mention, you can spend hundreds or thousands of hours on it with the intention of gaining a following only for it to amount to nothing. You're vying for everyone's interest against myriads of other people that have more money, time, and opportunities to grab that interest. This is only a defeatist mindset if you take this from the thought process that it's impossible. It's not impossible, it's just that you have one life. Are you really going to waste it competing against people you can't win against hoping "you're special" or "your niche is unique and will work out?" You certainly can, but I'd much rather focus on the things that are tangible as opposed to be another dreamer that hasn't been hit with a head on collision of reality too late in life.

            Also, I wouldn't mind being the Carrie Nation of Cell Phone Smashers either :)
