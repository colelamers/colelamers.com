                        Societies of every kind throughout all of history have some set of unwritten rules. They are usually means of establishing trust with others based off of your acceptance and understanding of them. These aren't always hard and fast beliefs you should have though. One can certainly deviate form them dramatically and still find others who adhere to the same understanding of the world. Take the Protestant reformation for a general example. During persecutions of both sides throughout (whether Huguenots in France or Catholics in the Low Countries), there were means in which these people could still associate their belief system with others. So even though the current mores dictated that they shouldn't believe in those ideals, lest they receive some sort of punishment, they could vet others through these mechanisms without totally saying outright what they believed.

                        Obvious right? Well it took me a while to learn this because I had a religious upbringing that caused me to believe lying was an always egregious mortal sin. So I'd always tell the truth. This naivete made me believe that other people told the truth too and that they should worry about their souls if they didn't. It wasn't until I sort of "deprogrammed" this belief that I realized you cannot engage life this way. People will take advantage of you for it if they find out and they will not care whatsoever. So learning to appropriately throw on these masks of affirming a status quo safeguards you from these people. You need to privy to many people who are far more kiniving than you are and will stop at nothing to keep knocking you down to ensure their success at the top.

                        The interesting aspect is there are some people at the top that invite open ideation and then there are others that do the same thing to find people out while also pretending to care. True and genuine psychopaths among us! And you might not even be aware of it. The complexity of these situations are for one thing, something you should keep to yourself until you are extremely comfortable with your surroundings. Otherwise, as one of my favorite quotes goes, "It behooves oneself to keep his wits."

                        So you must learn the culture before you can freely identify yourself. If you play your hand way too early, everybody will form an opinion of you right out of the gate and it will close off certain engagements you could've had. You will never engage beyond a surface level with some people and things will stay just the way they are. So the key is to feel out others first. Be a chameleon to tread water until you understand the situation that you're in. Many people might think this sounds two faced, and to others it sounds like you're wishy washy, and certain folks may believe you have no scruples. In fact, it's all the opposite, it's a mechanism for survival because brash honesty is unfairly punished.

                        Zum beispiel, if a Caliph is an adamant Sufi, has shown that he burns heathens, and there is an active environment for ousting Hindus, saying you are anything but a Sufi in the public eye is literal suicide. An odd example, but like in an environment where certain things get you

                        Having scruples when you are extremely financially vulnerable is what lesser intelligent people do because they perceive how financially secure bourgeois people exert them. That is because they can afford to deal with problems that come up. A poor person cannot and should not, until they can afford it as well. When you are on your own, you have no safety net. So you must play the game engaging with others as conservative as possible without kicking the hornets nest, so to speak.

                        What you need to do is minimize your own personal individuality unless it is seen as a positive thing. Anything you can share with others and they deem interesting or good is something you should actively engage in more often. You do not need to convert your entire life and you can differ in various ways. If exercising is deemed a positive activity, do more of it. If hanging out at bars after work is a typical social activity, you should take part even if you barely speak. The mere fact that you respect the rules with others is enough to show that acknowledge the environment.

                        This is where it becomes very tricky. You need to be aware of where you stand on certain topics and be prepared to hold firm, even in a brusque way, to show your displeasure. These people will dominate situations and make certain impositions upon you, such as using peer pressure to encourage you to do drugs. I was offered cigarettes at 16 by a coworker in a warehouse that I worked at. They'd harp on me all the time and criticize me a lot. Honestly, this is the one thing I do credit hardcore religion with saving me from. I held firm because breaking the law (underage smoking) was illegal and therefore broke God's law. Small examples like this are obviously anti-social and weird, but long term have resonated with myself emphasizing that these principles can bring about good. Although as you can see, you will be picked on, you will be made fun of, and you will be criticized. You become an easy target to belittle and paint in the social hierarchy at the bottom rung of the social ladder. So pick your battles carefully on what you're willing to engage with.

                        Maybe one day the dance of life will be more of a drunk ten minute waltz and less of a choreographed "we only have enough money to film it once, so don't mess up" music video.
