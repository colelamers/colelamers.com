                        Throughout history, there ends up becoming a social phenomena of human social groups that establish "unwritten rules," or Zeitgeist, which become the defacto manner in which people poise themselves. Eventually these establish customary norms and cultural adherences. In time, sub-cultures begin to propagate to the point of a gross dichotomy between the established bourgeoisie and the lower orders due to their high barrier to entry in the former.

                        As the aristocratic sphere becomes entrenched, these individuals learn ways to maintain, gain, and retain further strength through manipulating the aforementioned sub-cultures. Whereby enfranchising those lower orders anti-conservative viewpoints to the point of irrationality. The movie Agora does an incredible job of the rise of Christianity and displays many of the tactics in which it was capable of propagating. Although it does not just apply to Christianity. It applies to every religion. Be it Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, or even Contemporary Secularism (what I'd consider today as "Educationalism" or the inability to be skeptical of someone who has a specialized or higher level education than you; Think of them as "Secular Priests").

                        The unique facet surrounding this movie goes to show how lower orders of a disenfranchised class grow unchecked so long that they establish a mob rule of irrational beliefs. Eventually they gain political power, enough so that they can and will exert their will.

                        Eventually if you do not conform with the beliefs, no matter what you were brought up to believe, you will be condemned. It is infectious to such a radical degree that if it's not stamped out quickly, it will become an entrenched understanding sociologically as one of those Zeitgeists. What you'll find is, the higher social strata abide by them much quicker than the lower orders for fear of losing the position. Hence why we often see many people who are afraid of denouncing these sort of concepts they disagree with.

                        Looking at Protestantism's growth throughout Europe, is it not a wonder how fast it spread among the court systems the moment a ruler declared separation from Rome? Did all these people suddenly convert at the same time as their leader? Certainly some held those beliefs, but if you were a Duke without much power, are you really going to fight your King for the right to disagree knowing full well there are many Counts salivating over your Ducal title? Of course not. So you would kowtow accordingly in order to retain your status. Multiply that by ever other courtier looking to gain favors, and suddenly you've established a power hierarchy that has effectively revised the Zeitgeist of your culture. In fact, you make it abundantly clear what political statements are uncouth, tolerated, or career suicide.

                        This is why something like the concept of slavery retained it's weight for so long. Chattel slavery in particular was extraordinarily lucrative and wasn't stamped out fast enough before it to took hold and became the systemic standard. Eventually a civil war had to take place in the US to phase it out. Even then it didn't completely eradicate the practice because of it's economic value.

                        But this example goes to show what it takes to suppress certain thoughts and beliefs if given enough power throughout all structures of mankind. Yet unlike Rome, this belief was stamped out after a war that imposed certain lines of thinking among many. Rome integrated Christianity purely out a means of survival. The old conservative orders of Roman Paganism was dying because of the power struggle that ensued as it became beneficial to convert to Christianity in the courts.

                        In the clip for the video shown, the character they ask the question to at the end was a student of Hypatia, a mathemetician and astronomer in Alexandria. He is shown to be a Christian in the movie but before the clip, he and his class with Hypatia discuss the theory of Geocentrism. Clearly even with this idea, albeit incorrect, it demonstrated a spherical planetary system. Yet in the video toward the end, he is asked "Is the world round?" Knowing it's a trick question, he doesn't respond in the affirmative or negative. He suggested Geocentrism, yet knowing the political stakes, he returns a non-answer to appease the lesser intelligent Christians, knowing full well he cannot disagree because those very Christians will denounce him for it.

                        History has proven humans will seek their self interest, even if collectively the social upheaval will be a net negative on the entirety of society. Many from above will integrate various ideologies they would never agree with simply because they lack the power to fight the mob. If they did, this would give the justification for people to oust you or to assume you are bad because they are not in alignment with what is radically believed to be normal.

                        What I have noticed more after becoming irreligious is that religion doesn't necessarily have to be institutionalized in ways that the Western world has seen. It entrenches in people a fear of losing their livlihood so that they learn what they are allowed to socially discuss. When people are disallowed from talking about a particular concept, anything besides positive, they are now, in fact, participating in a religious movement. Especially if there are particular irrational concepts involved with the theology.

                        Often we'll also see the adherents utilize logical fallacies or circular arguments to refute people in disagreement. These tools allow lower order people to reign unchecked with an inquisitorial power with absolutely no repercussions. Higher orders adopt the lower orders system to protect their positions during the social upheaval. Suddenly the tide has turned and events are in motion. Enfranchisement has occurred and the lower orders become just like the Christians in the movie Agora. Motivated by the sheer movement of a cause, they will stop at nothing until either they or their group have achieved complete supremacy as the forefathers of a new found Zeitgeist.
