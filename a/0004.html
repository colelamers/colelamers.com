            This is a paper I wrote for my Bachelors Thesis with two other students in my class with their names addressed in the paper. Not really a whole lot to talk about besides it being somewhat of a hot topic at the time. The solution definitely seems out of reach and annoying for most non-techy people to be perfectly honest. Hell, I even get scared sometimes that some "reliable" executable I run just pwned me essentially. I think even telling normal people to reinstall and completely flash their hard drive with a fresh install of Windows is extremely egregious, even though that is basically one of the main steps in the process. Unfortunately, having backups and doing that definitely makes it more tedious. I have a decent system (that I may just talk about at a future date) but even I get panicked at times. But back to the thesis stuff a bit here.

            One of the weird things about writing this thesis has taught me with my colleagues is that research papers in the US are completely pointless. You must use highly referenced sources to sort of "pump" the veracity of your research. So you are to only only abide by "accepted sources." No novel ideas, no radical suggestions or assertions. If it does not abide by the main scholarly theology, it's inaccurate or not verifiable.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be perfectly honest, this sort of nonsense mentality is no different than scientific communities rejecting Gallileo with Heliocentrism or Ignaz Semmelweis with washing hands to help minimize mortality rates in hospitals. All good science (and the scientific method in general) is based on repeatable evidence. The logic does not always need to be completely accurate, but that doesn't mean that the idea isn't onto something. So why not let someone make a radical assertion? If it's not true, it will come about eventually.
          </p>
          <p>
            If just feels like the scientific community has subscribed to the old adage, "Nobody ever got fired for choosing IBM," except instead of choosing IBM, the just err on the side of not irritating the people who are on boards controlling some of these journals and articles. So what is the point of research? Just to build a resume? In many ways it just feels like this is the purpose for science nowadays in that it's a career to write papers and not change anything.
