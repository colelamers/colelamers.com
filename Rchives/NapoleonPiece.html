          <p>
            Having a short time to himself, Napoleon ended his reflection with the ancient Sphinx. It was not one thing he wished to dwell on too frequently. Now is the time for the aspect of war many men forget to partake. Propaganda and vanity win hearts and minds just as much as succeeding in war. The Expeditionary forces are not one which will last for much longer out here. Plague and attrition alone have taken more of the men’s lives than any battle the French have faced thus far. He knew he had to deliver a message to the Directory’s Minister of Propaganda.
          </p>
          <p>
            Napoleon had little else he could state at this time. His only true enemies were from within the acting government at this time. The Royalists despised him and Jacobin’s only sought to use him. Neither of which would appreciate the vision he had for the great nation which from before, had known hunger, cold, and pain more than remembering a time their bellies had yet once been full.
          </p>
          <p>
            The General’s staff met up with Napoleon as he made his way to the base camp. They began discussing pressing matters of their current situation. He acknowledged their significance and began planning whom to place the blame for the failure of the Egyptian campaign. It would not be difficult, but it would require one who had been around the longest making the most decisions next to himself. Once this had been done, upon his return
            would have to do little for the French people to absorb the truth, the one that they wished to believe.
          </p>
          <p>
            The people had utmost respect and faith in Napoleon at the time. He was a man that was perceived as one of the common folk but with a meritocratic right to rule unlike the majority of the Royalists that preserved
            authority by tradition alone. The Jacobin's hated them and likewise the anti-Jacobin’s as well. He could use this to his advantage at a later stage, further stoking flames to ensure his succession, but also remove his enemies.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this period, the events left to unfold were set in motion. Napoleon had set out back to France. The Egyptian Campaign was a pyrrhic victory for the Coalition. They had prevented his excursion to exceed beyond the middle east. At a great cost, the Coalition forces thus began certain infighting that allowed negotiations for the French to retain many of their territorial gains throughout the war. Had it not been so, the era
            have brought about more lasting peace due to the instability of the French government.
          </p>
          <p>
            Britain, being one of the dominant powers at the time, still had vast territories and resources it had controlled that needed to be prioritized. Britain, what one may have perceived, had been in a constant state of conflict since the Seven Years war. Internal strife, colonial insurrections, and ongoing skirmishes throughout had prepared her for instigation on a moment's notice. The Empire had the greatest navy known to the world which could easily blockade the French. Consolidating those efforts however was a bureaucratic process of determining which Lord personally wanted to risk their retinues for the Crown. While honor, glory, and a cabinet, ministerial, or generalship position would be allotted, the loss would also pose a stark attack on one's own possessions by the sheer nature of the internal political affairs of the British Peerage system. Many aristocrats wanted to safeguard themselves from eager opponents within more so than an invader from the outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Russian had not been wholly prepared and also sought a quick end. While they did not attribute much of the losses, they also did not gain much from their efforts. Poland had been retained as a client of the French, something the Tsar had still claimed for Russian possession. With the significant costs of maintaining an army far away from Moscow, the fervor for war waned significantly. The grown Anglo-Turkic alliance had worried Tsar Alexander, and the British attempts at monitoring their trade caused him to all but renounce further action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Austrian capitulation was no different. Of the treaties signed, they had lost the most. All of their coastline had been annexed forcing them permanently out of the Mediterranean. The Hapsburg Dynasty now no longer held sway over Germanic princes it once had. It’s prestige waned in awe of the growing Empires west of her borders and could not properly maintain any of what the global powers could. Her reach had extended from Constantinople to Hanover. Russia spanned two continents now reaching a gateway to another ocean, Britain determined international trade policies, the Ottomans prevented expansions into the East, and Prussia was a military state they could no longer challenge. Of all the most shamed from the events that had ended, Austria had received the worst.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hostilities had yet ended with enumerable treaties signed. All which appeared to strengthen the French Republic further. How had a tumultuous and failing state become so vast and so powerful in such a short time? Britain had recognized this problem but was not capable of stopping it’s expansion. It needed the Coalition forces to aid where she lacked with such sparsely laid out armies across the globe. It could preserve trade, protecting and ensuring economic stability with her navy. Others could provide the land forces that could buy the British time to employ an invasion. But with all other members having left, she could not do much else. Peace had to be maintained if she were to prepare for further hostilities. Much of which Buckingham was salivating for the prospect to partake in yet again…
          </p>
          <p>
            Again Napoleon was met with these inner thoughts like he was at the Sphinx. On his personal Threedecker frigate, masked with an artisanal siren-ized version of Liberté, to further exemplify the establishment of the French Republic.
          </p>
          <p>
            He peered out toward the Mediterranean. On his way back, shortly nearing his home Corsica, he could not shake these feelings. They were taunting him from behind, like an ache another could not empathize with or a kind of phantom limb. It was perched upon his shoulders, constantly sighing from behind. Reminding him of his past failures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the man’s confidence was not shaken. No it was a furrowed brow and a deep stare at the Mediterranean waves that left him puzzled. He had realized what was about to unfold was not unbecoming of him. The Royalists of Europe although were not fond of a commoner like himself rising to power. Much like Oliver Cromwell, he too may see a dejected fate that ought to have been praised. Like the two of them, they had not been born into the right of rule, but earned it. He had believed that in the face of death, challenging moments brought forth many ways one could gain if they ignore the possibility that they in fact shall die because of failure. Once that has occurred, man can achieve many things to become great. He can conquer the world over, bit by bit, country by country, empire by empire.
          </p>
          <p>
            With little planning aside by garnering proper support from those who matter dearest, he was prepared to remove the Directory. Eviction was not his aim. It was to take over the entire system for his own. Much like Caesar, he would cross this Rubicon, but with more than an army. He had political support, populist adoration, and a loyal military that none could challenge. He was also being welcomed with open arms. Caesar had been met with further conflict and Senators garnering spite every moment he retained his dictatorship. Napoleon did not have that issue. In order to maintain their positions in the Assembly, many Frenchmen supported him with sincerest and stout hearts. Either by proxy to stay elected, or by genuine fervent desire. Napoleon had done what no rule had done before him since the likes of the Great Gaius Julius himself. He had earned the right to rule...although just not yet. Things were still to be set in motion. Napoleon had to make his mark permanent. He had to begin alerting people to what he had hoped to transpire and reckon with all of France. The French were entitled an end to the revolutionary uprisings that still persisted. They must receive it with one who can give it to them swiftly which a tepid bureaucrat cannot.
          </p>
          <p>
            He has traveled the likes of the World not seen since Caesar or Alexander themselves. His victories mount amongst the repeated shortcomings of the hegemonic monarchies claiming the right to rule. The force of nature, swift and unending in his endeavors to become Europe’s greatest Emperor. Crowned not by birth, but by merit. The Coalition forces have been keeping some of French expansions at bay, but they could not contain all that shall be achieved soon enough. They will be driven to submission soon even with their slight victories retaining Egypt. It will give them the satiated desire they’ve been looking for to sue for peace. It is just another anticipated move he had wagered may not work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Napoleon envisioned the Sphinx from before. The emptiness of the seas was reminiscent of the emptiness of the desert all too much. His gaze was filled with wonder, as if consulting a Pythian Oracle herself.
          </p>
          <p>
            What road lie ahead for the man? The Directory was in shambles due to economic failings receiving universal disfavor. Would he return to France and achieve more than what he has done already? Or remain as one of the hundreds of generals seldom named for any of their achievements? Building his reputation up from an officer in the ranks of aristocrats who bought their way in; He was something more. The Sphinx dead stare from his memory did not provide an epiphany. With the gloomy, bright desert air, whisking sand around with it’s occasional gust, these visions appeared to be delusions of grandeur more so than legitimate aspirations. Not many men are given a personal Rubicon that will alter just their destinies, but the world over.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sullen looking Napoleon expressed internal conflict as he pondered this. Life does not end once one achieves something great. It begets more trials known only to a minuscule group of men whose luck and determination granted them the opportunity to experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where this will lead me, he was filled with an uneasiness. His outward mask employs confidence in the Armee, as he is the Thunder of it’s stormy strike. He must quell these thoughts before they overtake his very soul. Having accepted the matters laid bare before him. The Pharaohs here have been conquered and reclaimed all the more. He must leave now to pursue what lies ahead. He shall never know peace; strife will overtake him unto death. The fate of him has not been sealed, but merely just begun.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the ship began to reach the port, a demon in his head lurched upon Napoleon's back once more.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It will mean death!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “You will fail to convince them”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Your own brother will not stick his neck out”
          </p>
          <p>
            “What about the bloodshed?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Can you trust them?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “How will you convince the other Powers of your right?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Will you end your life in the event of failure?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The whispers came about in a daunting, slithering. Hissing at each suggesting. Soaking in with each breath glossing outward of its silvery tongue. It flowed in one ear, permeating on top of each new suggestion. It was not a thought. A confident man does not think in such a way. It was a reminder of humility in man. Humble men succumb to these machinations. They give in too quickly and undergo a pessimism of behavior that prevents them from worry. They are a nullified state of being that cannot barricade the conscience of man from within itself! Surely he was not this man, yet here being tormented with the afflictions of such a man.
          </p>
          <p>
            Would he see to it, through all the conspiracy in which it will be engaged? He would not yield to the thoughts that bear fruit here. Having tamed much of Europe to the wills of his own tactical and oratory prowess. He has only begun playing the pieces in a precise manner of which the world has never yet seen. The enemies of one man were many, yet equals few, slimming by the day as his achievements amass greater momentum. His reckoning force that Europe has not witnessed since that of Attila. Like a cannon ball mid flight, the wave of his ambition could not be stopped. Destiny is predetermined with little factors from beyond that can adjust the final resting place of a man such as this. It is not becoming of someone such as that to yield; no one man can resist these tenacious desires. The die will lie where it falls, but it will not be the final outcome. Unless death comes without recognition, it shall not be stopped by not even the greatest the world has to offer. To be perpetually in the minds of all, he will last for all annals in the histories. If it cannot be achieved, then his accomplishments have not been worthy of remembrance.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was aware his confidence permeated beyond where he stood. The lot in life given to him was not only a burden, but of internal strife he could never share. His essence espoused a swagger that drove fear into others by his mere presence. To be such a man, one must be worthy of praise. He was such a man, for he knew it, breathed it, all effortlessly. Such a man that will be deigned, Emperor Napoleon.
