            I don't know if any of you have ever experienced the worst feeling one can ever experience in a social setting just short of balling your eyes out, but hot damn I sure have way too many times. That thought process, where you're just like "Hey, this sounds like it could be really funny!" and you prep yourself. You're just like "alright when's the right time to lay this puppy down." Then you find your moment and...
          </p>
          <p>
            The cringe, the reactions, the failure, the way people now think about you. You failed a social litmus test, you might even have come across as a creep. Maybe a psychotic freak. Or worse, you actually offended someone. Better yet, you might've made someone cry.
          </p>

            I hate to say this but I definitely am guilty of all of those. Although the only ones I remember either landed really well but still came across as weird, or just bombed so hard that I want to self-flagellate myself with a whip for punishment on being such a social weirdo. God, there are few where I just wish I could've retracted them as they were being said. It was like time slowed down and I could see myself trying to grab the air containing the horrible joke to prevent it from landing on those peoples ears. They're incredibly humbling experiences in the worst way I can say that.
          </p>

            It's a horrible curse to want to make people laugh because you will bomb hard so many times. I have to admit the high of landing a perfectly timed joke that gets a big laugh is unrivaled in most social settings. There are just so many systems at play that can prove your social intelligence quickly or disprove it even quicker. Like attemping to impress people with more confidence and money than you could ever dream of. You'd be lucky to make that person laugh in front of others they respect. Honestly, you're probably better off making them look like a bigot of whatever kind that tickles your fancy so that they're required to laugh in order to not come across as an outright jerk.
          </p>

            And yet, I'm still compelled to say some of these jokes. It's awful sometimes because at times it could be like throwing out a feeler to guage the room or person. Then you basically just destroy all credibility of you as a person. It feels like in those crappy Sims games for the GBA where if you say the wrong thing, the persons friend meter just drops to like the absolute bottom and you gotta start all over again. Except people in real life actually cut you off for petty stuff like this at times. I'm not saying it's not valid, but it just makes telling jokes so difficult cause you run those risks ever time. It makes it hard for me to be me at times because I struggle with that often.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other times it's like I put my foot in my mouth while digging a twelve foot hole that only gets deeper. At best, all I can do is shrug hoping my faux pas is nothing but an assumption that my jokes aren't good. Unfortunately I always felt like my failure required me to wear a veil of shame. I desire to shave my head with lashings upon my back as evidence for my regret and melancholy. Or at least acceptance that I'm joking to get a laugh not to be mean.
          </p>

            Like Mark Twain said "For business reasons, I must preserve the outward signs of sanity." I cannot live my life as a lamenting Lamers. I have to continue forward and hope I'm not unemployable because I am a person who just has a terrible gauge of humor at times. I don't think the loss of money or status is what worries me. It's the perception that people will not want to associate with me at all because of my poor uptake on certain social cues all for the sake of a poor taste joke that failed.

            Like the scorpion to the frog, "It's in my nature."
