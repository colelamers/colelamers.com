            Recently I had been thinking about diving back into Linux again since I've been looking into downsizing a lot of useless tech and household items I have. Needing to know a little bit about Linux for maintaining my VPS's, it seemed like a good idea. But instead of hastily uninstalling Windows for whatever "flavor-of-the-day" distro's out there, I decided to just see how far I could go on my raspberry pi with 4GB of ram. Needless to say, within 30 minutes, I was completely reminded why Linux is just in a horrific state not even worth venturing beyond a terminal with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firstly, raspbian is a debian-based distro. Sparing the details, it's just one of the more "main" versions of Linux with default packages and applications. For whatever reason, I'm incapable of doing the most basic aspect of working within the terminal, a simple "sudo apt-get update." Again, sparing the details, this is in the Linux world, the equivalent to "riding a bike." So what was my problem? The default url's the app points to just couldn't fetch the updates. You look up how to resolve it, and it almost looks like a wikipedia entry from someone on stackoverflow on what's causing it and how to go about fixing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            But to not be able to do the most basic part of downloading and installing applications? How did Linux somehow get worse? Earlier this year, I believe I attempted to install over 10 different distros on my custom built PC, each one having an equally annoying issue, such as: black screen if refresh rate greater than 60hz, sleep mode puts computer in unwakable hibernation, dual monitors cause the screen on the monitors to be offset, GUI bugs in every desktop environment to some degree, wifi drivers not working, kernel panics, having to revert to an older LTS version of a kernel because the current version has a bug where you can't have greater than 1366x768 monitor resolution, and the list gets even worse when it's a problem that can only be solved via terminal or the random config files littered throughout.
          </p>
          <p>
            Linux is just in a nightmare state altogether. All I can do is laugh whenever some programmer with more free-time than an elementary school student recommends Linux. My favorite quips are when they say their parents or family uses it. Yes, and they also have dedicated staff to help troubleshoot errors, a-la said programmer. Windows has been "it just works"TM since Windows 8.1 and Mac's as well but not as involved. There isn't even a single distro I would even recommend to a CS student right now. I'd just tell them to exclusively jump into TTY and don't even bother with a desktop. Linux is in such a garbage state that the only thing that will honestly save it is when 50-100 years down the road, sanctioned governments incapable of getting Windows will just develop their own version of Linux like the North Koreans. At the current state of affairs, its just a colossal nightmare of highly opinionated maintainers that love to take the high road of "it works for me" and also are so xenophobic to working with other distros that they think forking, and then wasting their time building their version of the hydra, will somehow make things better.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of my favorite arguments from some of these programmer types is they'll say "Did you use approved hardware?" First off, I'm not a mechanical engineer. Chances are the average non-computer oriented person is either. Looking into approved hardware beyond "Can I run x, y, and z software?" is already outside the scope of time that everybody who already has a billion other commitments have. I know what I'm doing even, and that is quite possibly one of the most asinine comments I could ever be told. I'm not going out of my way to buy hardware specific to run this random operating system. If I was going to do that, I'd just buy a Mac. Apple products by the way, are so damn plug-n-play easy to use that it's easier for me to just these expensive toys and hand them to my parents than it is to save money and be tech support in my spare time. Apple targets people who honest to god don't care about programmer minutia. At the end of the day, you just need to get work done. As far as I'm aware, people who program on Linux waste more time getting config files working or tweaking settings to be "just right" than they do actually completing any objectives.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wouldn't even pay for a distro at this point solely because I know that money is just going to get fed into an ether of competition with other free distros. As I mentioned previously, it is really going to take the funding of a state government or Microsoft themselves to honestly create a default distro that works out of the box like the other two main desktop operating systems. As it stands, Linux is like picking a lottery ticket with 9/10 odds you'll get zapped by a cattle prod if it's not right. That 1/10 is that nerd who pushes up his glasses, with the greatest amount of pretentiousness you can imagine, who also has no hobbies outside of sitting in front of a screen and complaining that everyone is stupid because they can't use a computer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Honestly the most ironic thing in my life has been the huge 180 I've had on computers in general after getting my CS degree. I used to love poking at all this stuff and trying to make it work. Now, I just look at it and balk at how much I have to work...just to get to work. When I get done with my job, the absolute last thing I want to do in my free time is work on another damn computer doing devops work. I just want my software to work. I don't want to modify some random file located in an esoteric location because Linus Torvalds said it was a good idea back in 1992 and nobody bothered to question it. Linux is just a nightmare today and it's just not even worth touching for the foreseeable future. The basic gist is, if you hear someone talking about Linux, just roll your eyes and double down on being a moron like me. You'll be happier that you're not having to learn all this pointless crap that some jack-wagon lone-wolf developer decides to change in two years, just straight up stop supporting, or actively rejects making fixes.

            Long story short, Desktop Linux is for Losers. Please see the video below for further details.
